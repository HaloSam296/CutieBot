# CutieBot
A small bot I've been working on

Obviously a Discord Bot. The flask webserver is used in hand with uptimerobot.com to keep it running on Repl.it, despite normal limitations. Basically, make the webserver,
set up a monitor on uptimerobot to ping the webserver every 5 minutes, and let it run. The bot will be fully hosted online for free. As of 06/15/2022, Repl.it has not patched or made any changes to this process.
