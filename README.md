# CutieBot
A small bot I've been working on

Obviously a Discord Bot. The flask webserver is used inhand with uptimerobot.com to keep it running on Repl.it, despite normal limitations. Basically, make the webserver,
set up a monitor on uptimerobot to ping the webserver every 5 minutes, and let it run. The bot will be fully hosted online for free. As of 10/02/2021, Repl.it has not patched
or made any changes to this process.
